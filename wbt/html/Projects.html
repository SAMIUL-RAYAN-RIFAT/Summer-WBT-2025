                <h3>Hotel Management System </h3> <img src="/wbt/image/htl.jpg" width="300" height="300">
            </div>

            <p>Developed a role-based Hotel Management System using Java, featuring three types of users: Admin,
                Employee, and Customer. Customers can view room details, check pricing, and book available rooms. Admins
                have full control over the system â€” including managing room status (booked/available), updating prices,
                assigning room rent, and handling employee salaries. Employees can assist in operational tasks. The
                project emphasizes modular design, object-oriented programming, and real-world use cases such as room
                booking and payment handling.</p>

                <h3>School Management System </h3> <img src="/wbt/image/scl.png" width="300" height="300">
            </div>
            <p>Designed and developed a C#-based School Management System with three user roles: Admin, Teacher, and
                Student. Teachers can assign courses, submit results, share homework, notes, and send notifications.
                Students can view academic results, access notes, ask for counseling, check routines, and find classroom
                locations. Admins have full control to update course availability, modify course fees, manage academic
                calendars, and broadcast notifications to both teachers and students. The system follows modular and
                user-centric design to ensure efficiency in academic operations.</p>

                    width="300" height="300">
            </div>

            <p>Designed and developed a desktop application for smart healthcare management, featuring role-based access
                for Patients, Doctors, and Admins. The system includes an AI-powered symptom checker that uses a machine
                learning model to provide preliminary diagnoses based on user input. Patients can book appointments,
                receive prescriptions, view medical history, and get automated health reminders. Doctors can manage
                appointments, update treatment plans, and track patient records. The application simulates real-time
                health data and provides printable medical reports. Emphasizes OOP, modular architecture, and efficient
                healthcare workflow automation.</p>
