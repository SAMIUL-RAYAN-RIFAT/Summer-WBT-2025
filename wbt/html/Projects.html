                </div>

                <p> By using Java,developed a basic Travel Management System with two user roles: Manager, customer. In
                    the system, manager can add different packages of plans for the traveler along with different
                    prices.Traveler can view the plans and book the plan of their choice. The system is designed to be
                    user-friendly, with a focus on modular design and object-oriented programming principles.

                </div>
                <p>Developed a School Management System in C# featuring three distinct user roles: Admin, Teacher, and
                    Student.
                    Teachers are able to assign courses, upload results, share study materials, and send announcements.
                    Students can view grades, download notes, check class schedules, and register for available courses.
                    Admins have comprehensive control over course availability, fee management, academic calendar
                    updates, and can send notifications to all users.
                    The system is designed with a modular and user-friendly approach to streamline academic workflows.

                </div>

                <p>Created a Computer Graphics project in C++ titled “Journey to Dhaka”, featuring three visually
                    distinct scenes: Village, Padma Bridge, and Dhaka City.
                    The project includes interactive elements such as keyboard and mouse controls, and showcases 2D
                    animations to simulate a smooth transition between scenes.
                    The work highlights fundamental graphics techniques including object transformation, scene
                    rendering, event handling, and animation logic, demonstrating a complete journey experience through
                    visual storytelling.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Developed a Machine Learning model in Python to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie
                    reviews.
                    Preprocessed the text data using NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
                    Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier to classify reviews as positive or negative, achieving high
                    accuracy.
                    Used scikit-learn for model building and evaluation, including confusion matrix, precision, recall,
                    and F1 score metrics.</p>
